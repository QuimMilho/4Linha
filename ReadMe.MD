# Connect 4

This project was developed by Joaquim Milheiro.

It's a simple connect four gameplay. When you run the project there are three options you can choose from!

The first one (Single Player) makes you play against a simple "AI" that generates its play randomly

The second one (Multi Player 1 vs 1) allows you to play against another player!

Finally, the third choice allow you to see a game you played and saved previously!

# Gameplay

When you start the game, it prints an empty board. The board is 8 by 8 and you can only place pieces from the bottom to the top.

After you choose a place to play it will check if its a valid place.

Everytime a play is made, the program will automatically check if any player has won. It will only check vertical and horizontal lines.

If one player wins, or it's a tie, the game ends and the board will be shown with an option of saving the game.
